numerical-mooc-lesson_codes
===========================
These files include the codes I have written for the lessons in the IPython Notebooks, as part of the online class
MAE6286 Practical Numerical Methods with Python, offered by The George Washington University.
This is my first time using python, github, ipython notebooks, etc., so I would be
grateful for any and all advice, feedback etc.
